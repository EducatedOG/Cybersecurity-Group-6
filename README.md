Our project’s objective is to conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment across five critical host servers, systematically identifying security weaknesses, evaluating their potential impact, and recommending actionable steps. Through this process, we aim to enhance our security posture by thoroughly identifying, analyzing, and addressing vulnerabilities, ensuring robust protection against threats and minimizing risks to our network infrastructure. By strengthening our network’s resilience, we are better prepared to defend against potential cyber threats and secure our data integrity.
